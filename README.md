CREPE: CRoss-Entropy Parameter Estimation is a project aiming to create a simple yet powerful global optimization tool.

CREPE is compatible with Python 2.7. Compatibility with other versions of Python is not yet verified. Required packages: 'nose', 'numpy'. Recommended packages: 'matplotlib', 'pip'.

Known issues:
* The program doesn't know how to deal with infinities and roots of negatives

To be added in the future:
* Creating standard performance functions
* Multi-variate gaussian distributions
